```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(viridis)
library(ghibli)
library(scales)

pal <- function(col, border = "light gray", ...)
  {
  n <- length(col)
  plot(0, 0, type="n", xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1),
       axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "", ...)
  rect(0:(n-1)/n, 0, 1:n/n, 1, col = col, border = border)
  }
```

## Join: Full

Joins merge data sets based on key variables. The syntax is always `name_join(x, y, by = "key")`

Animated visuals created by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain)

* `full_join()`: keeps all observations in x and y

```{r full, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/full-join.gif")
```

## Join: Left, Right

* `left_join()`: keeps all observations in x

```{r left, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/left-join.gif")
```

* `right_join()`: keeps all observations in y

## Join: Inner

* `inner_join()`: keeps observations in both x and y

```{r inner, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/inner-join.gif")
```

## Colors: Discrete

Color used to distinguish groups requires a qualitative color scale that is

* finite and unordered
* readily distinguished
* approximately equivalent

```{r rainbow, fig.height = 3}
#show_col(rainbow(6))
pal(rainbow(7), main = "Base: Rainbow")
```

## Colors: Continuous

Color used to representing values or comparative magnitude requires a sequential color scheme that 

* uses a many-valued gradient to distinguish larger/smaller values
* represets the distance between values
* may be single-hued, multi-hued, diverging

```{r viridis, fig.height = 3}
#show_col(viridis_pal()(16))
pal(viridis_pal()(16), main = "Viridis:viridis")
```

## Colors: Highlight

Color to highlight a group or threshold value requires accent colors that

* stands out/pops relative to the rest of the colors
* may be a single color against grey backdrop
* may be baed on intensity of colors in color scale

```{r ghibli, fig.height = 3}
#show_col(ghibli_palette("KikiLight", 4))
pal(ghibli_palette("KikiLight", 4), main = "Ghibli:KikiLight")
```

## Colors: Tips and Resources

Potential pitfalls

1. Encoding too much information (e.g., more than 5 to 8 groups)
    - Labeling points is an alternative
2. Coloring for the sake of coloring
   - And using oversaturated colors
3. Using non-monotonic scales for values (e.g., the rainbow scale)
4. Ignoring accessibility (e.g., color perception)
